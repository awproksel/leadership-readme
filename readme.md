This is my version of the so-called "leadership readme" or a "how I lead" reference for anyone that works directly with me.  

### About Me

I've been in technology for more than a decade and I am still tying to figuring it all out.  I climbed the ladder of engineering through the lens of a [site reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) and "devops engineer" (not a real job title, ask me more!).  As such, I'm used to looking at complex systems and figuring out why the cogs are misaligned and providing a simple but effective solution.  

Also, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, Lego & reality tv cooking shows.  

### My Role

My role is to be accountable for the decisions, progress and general success.  I am **not** here to make all the decisions nor should I or should you let me.

Everyday I work to guide, advise and facilitate the growth of our team and our impact on the products we build and support.  

### How I Lead

#### My style

I lead projects and endeavors using 3 sequential modes: visioning, demonstrating, stewarding and 5 sequential questions: what, why, how, who & when

#### I trust my team

I trust each and every member of our team.  Trust isn't earned, it's lost.

#### I like to be challenged 

I would like to think I know everything but that just isn't the case.  I hire smart people because I like to surround myself with opinionated, passionate, hard-working people.  Please challenge my ideas, thoughts and feedback.  If you're not comfortable doing it in a group setting please make sure to voice your thoughts in our 1o1.  

#### I embrace a work/life balance

I typically work between 8am and 6pm, and unless there's an emergency, I don't expect to communicate with you (about work) outside of these hours.  As such, I **never** expect you to respond to me outside these hours either unless it is an emergency.  

#### I want you to be and feel productive 

Regardless of where you work, our success relies on your independence and autonomy.  My role is to provide a framework and support so you can be productive and *feel* productive.  If our processes or procedures don't enable you to be productive or feel productive make sure to tell me.  

#### I want our team to add value

I love talking technology and can do so for hours on end; but technology is rarely the only component an engineering team produces or supports.  I expect the team to focus on adding business value and making decisions that ensure we can and do deliver on our commitments to the business and our customers.

#### I want you to grow

I expect the team to have a passion for learning and growing and I will do my best to challenge and entice you to learn new and exciting things. 

#### I want your feedback

"Feedback is a gift"  

#### ISMs! 

Rocket Mortgage (previous Quicken Loans) has a well codified culture in the [ISMs](https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies).  These ideals get to the guts of what it means to be a team member.  Read them, use them, live them.  

### Your Role

A team's success is not defined by any one person's achievements or failures.  

> Each and every member of our team needs to help positively influence, guide, change, and improve our product, technology & processes.   

That is your role and the role of everyone on the team.  At times you will need to be able to change the mindsets and beliefs of your team; this give and take, these professional debates, are not optional.  They **will** make you a better engineer and leader, but they can be trying and often difficult.  I'm here to provide guidance and course correct the conversation if need be, but I cannot and will not speak for you.  


#### 1 on 1 Meetings

You should schedule a weekly, 30 minute conversation with me.  I prefer that you schedule the meeting, so you can pick a time (and place) that works for you, your schedule, and avoids interrupting your flow.  

Our chats should be less about the status of your work, and more about *how* work is going. These are **your** meetings, but if you need a few ideas of things we can talk about, here is a brief list:

- new ideas you have that you need a sounding board for
- if there is something I can do to guide you, coach you
- if you're having a problem and you don't know how to attack it
- if you want to discuss something and need someone to listen

Our initial conversation *will* be a bit different.  Here are a few of the questions I typically ask during that session (h/t to [Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/))

- What makes you grumpy?
- How will I know when you're grumpy?
- How can I help you when you're grumpy? 

- How do you prefer feedback? (in scheduled 1o1, as-it-happens, via text, phone, smoke signal?)
- How do you prefer to receive recognition (publicly or privately)

- How do we make 1o1s value to you?

- Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?

- What's your favorite way to treat yourself?
